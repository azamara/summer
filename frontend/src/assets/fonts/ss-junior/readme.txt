SS Junior v1.001


--------------------
Web
--------------------

Start by first uploading the "webfonts" folder to your webserver. Then place this link tag within the <head> tags of your HTML:

    <link href="webfonts/ss-junior.css" rel="stylesheet" />

There are two common methods to use and reference symbols.

The first is use a symbol alongside a complementary word. Using class names, with CSS :before pseudo elements and Unicode code points, we can append symbols to words. In this example we're adding a check symbol to a submit button:

    <button class="ss-star">Favorite</button>

The second way is to use a symbol in place of a word. This method triggers symbols with semantic keywords. When using this method on the web apply the generic "ss-icon" class to the element wrapping the keyword.

For example, when showing that a settings field is locked:

    Settings <i class="ss-icon">locked</i>

A cog symbol will be displayed alongside the text "Settings".

When using the replacement technique, sighted users will see symbols and search engines and screen readers will see the semantic keyword.

You can also use symbols with their direct Unicode value. See documentation.html for a full list of supported icons. This example will show a star icon:

    <i class="ss-icon">&#x22C6;</i> Favorites


--------------------
Use with other sets
--------------------

If using in conjunction with another Symbolset (ie. Standard), include a reference to both CSS files (default set should be last) and add the secondary font's CSS class (ie. ".ss-standard") where desired.

    <link href="webfonts/ss-standard.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="webfonts/ss-junior.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    ...
    <i class="ss-icon">Star</i>
    <i class="ss-icon ss-standard">Grid</i>
